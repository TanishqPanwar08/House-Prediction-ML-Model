We prepare a Machine Learning Model (Multivariable Linear Regression ) on House Prediction for Delhi Dataset


Introduction:

Linear regression is a powerful statistical technique that can be used to create predictive models based on historical data. In the context of house prediction, linear regression can be used to identify the relationship between various features of a house and its price. By analyzing historical data on house prices and characteristics, we can build a model that can predict the price of a new house based on its features.

Description:

To create a house prediction model using linear regression, we first need to identify the relevant features that could impact the price of a house. These features might include factors such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the location of the house, and the age of the house.

Once we have identified the relevant features, we can collect historical data on houses that have been sold in the past. This data should include information on the features of each house as well as the price that it sold for.

Using this data, we can build a linear regression model that can predict the price of a new house based on its features. This model will be based on a mathematical formula that identifies the relationship between the different features and the price of the house.

To validate our model, we can use a technique called cross-validation. This involves dividing the historical data into two sets: a training set and a validation set. We can use the training set to build our model and then use the validation set to test how well our model performs. If our model performs well on the validation set, we can be confident that it will perform well on new data.

Overall, creating a house prediction model using linear regression requires careful selection of features, thorough data analysis, and appropriate model validation techniques. By following these steps, we can build a model that can accurately predict the price of a new house based on its features.
